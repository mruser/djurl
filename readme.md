# djurl

Djurl is an attempt at providing [Django](http://djangoproject.com) [URL dispatching](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/topics/http/urls/) for [node.js](http://nodejs.org).

## Key Features

* Simple action dispatching
* Familiar to Django users
* Supports Python regex named capture groups (e.g. `(?P<groupname>.*?)`)


## Usage

URL dispatching is basic:

    var djurl = require("djurl");
    
    /* indexAction and fooAction functions */
    
    /* Define patterns */
    var patterns = djurl.urlpatterns([
        ["^/$", indexAction, "index"],
        ["^/foo/(?P<action>\\w+)/$", fooAction],
    ]);

    http.createServer(function(req, res) {
        djurl.dispatch(patterns, req, res); /* url processing starts here */
    }).listen(8080);

`urlpatterns` accepts an array of pattern arrays with the following format:

* `path` - String containing path to compile to RegExp
* `action` - Function to dispatch on matching path
* `name` (Optional) - String containing named handle to url pattern

Actions should accept the following arguments:
    
* `request` - Node request object
* `response` - Node response handle
* `path` - Object containing path info
* `name` - String containing path name defined in `urlpatterns`
  
## N.B.

* Make sure Regex character classes are escaped properly: `\\w+` instead of `\w+`

## TODO

* Better 404 handling
* Robustness
* Performance
* Extend Node request object?
